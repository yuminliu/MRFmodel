# MRFmodel
a Markov Random Field model related to a climate project

This is a Python implementation of the algorithm described in the KDD2019 paper ''Nonparametric Mixture of Sparse Regressions on Spatio-Temporal Data -- An Application to Climate Prediction'', which can be download from [here](https://www.kdd.org/kdd2019/accepted-papers/view/nonparametric-mixture-of-sparse-regressions-on-spatio-temporal-data-an-appl).

Python version: 3.5+

usage:
1) download all 3 folders and files into a folder.
2) extract toy data from ''6models_wholeUSA_synthetic3_21random11_36months6to1p_0.01_0.01_8.0_random.rar'' in the ./data/synthetic/ folder
3) run mainsns.py in the src folder.
4) the results will be in the /results folder.
